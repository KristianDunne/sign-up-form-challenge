# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to a coding challenge by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

![Design preview for the Intro component with sign up form coding challenge](./public/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

"Your challenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_"

## Implementation and Tools

- React Application
- Tailwind CSS
- Form built with Formik
